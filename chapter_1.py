""" 1. Write an English sentence with understandable semantics but incorrect syntax.
Write another English sentence which has correct syntax but has semantic errors.

Solution:
If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit,
and you will not be able to run your program. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
this sentence contains a syntax error. So does this one

If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will produce the output you wanted to see. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do by writing the program.  The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong
